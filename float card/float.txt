Some strech goals

- Indented H2 with the special type of M like in a Shrek book

- Shadows for the .card

- using ems on the inside for everything and playing around with the font-size on the card

- adding some special details with absolute positioning. (shapes on the sides)

- a link at the end to see more

P.S. write a script that when called automatically creates a folder with .html and .css file and .txt file
