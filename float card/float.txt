Some strech goals

- Indented H2 with the special type of M like in a Shrek book

- using ems on the inside for everything and playing around with the font-size on the card

P.S. write a script that when called automatically creates a folder with .html and .css file and .txt file

- I want that corner to scale above card on hover
